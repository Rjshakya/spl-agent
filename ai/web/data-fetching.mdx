# Data Fetching using Hono Client

## Architecture Overview

Server will export hono app client instance
const frontend will use that.

## Implementation Details

### Server Side

```typescript
import type { app } from "./app";
import { hc } from "hono/client";

export type Client = ReturnType<typeof hc<typeof app>>;
export const hcWithType = (...args: Parameters<typeof hc>): Client =>
  hc<typeof app>(...args);
```

```typescript client side
import { hcWithType } from "server/hc";

const client = hcWithType("http://localhost:8000", {
  init: { credentials: "include" },
});
export default client;
```

This client have typed api of backend , with all type safety , inputs , outputs.
This is how will gonnna use.

we will make custom hook for each backend service , (if not too big).
